# Customer-Churn-Prediction
The task at hand involves creating a churn prediction model for a DTH provider facing intense market competition. The primary goal is to identify potential account churns, considering that a single account may encompass multiple customers. Losing an account translates to losing multiple customers, making account retention crucial.
As the assigned individual responsible for developing the churn prediction model, the objective is to provide insightful business recommendations for targeted campaigns. These campaigns should be unique and offer clear, valuable incentives to potential churners. It is essential to avoid recommending overly generous or subsidized offers that might lead to financial losses for the company.

Therefore, the campaign suggestions must strike a balance between customer retention and financial prudence
